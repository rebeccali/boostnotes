Data driven modeling and Probabilistic Scientific Computing 

### Motivation
Huge sensor and data collection. 2012 CNNs revolutionized image recognition in ImageNet competition. 

Gaussian Process Regression. 

GAN - High dimensional regression 
Everybody dance now 

Open challenges: Self driving, CFD - lots of data vs lots of models. ML vs computational science and engineering (CSE).

We want to know: $y = f(x) + \epsilon$ and $P(y|x)$.

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is knowing some classification or do some sort of regression. Use probabilistic models. 
Regression: We want to know about things we have not observed based on things we have observed. 
Classification: sort cats and dogs, types of blood cells? This is hard to have rich inputs and outputs due to a need for experts. 

### Unsupervised learning 
We want to discover latent variables $z$ as well as $y=f(z) + \epsilon$. Applications are density estimation, clustering. 

Dimensionality reduction. 

Generating molecules for properties. IDEA: autoencoders for differential flatness? search in the low dimensional space

Bayesian vs Frequentists 

Course Goals:

Analyze y synthesize data, model systems. Hands on contemporary ML tools. Will lots of programming in python. Applications for these tools. Mid term. Final project (1-2 ppl, primarily individual).

This versus other classes - not as theoretical as 520, not as practical as 519, Mostly following Murphy, but some Bishop (Pattern Recognition and ML), DL by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville, and then Gaussian processes Rasmussen+ Williams. 

First assignment: install software. 

For everything in the class, will not need cloud compute. Project may need cloud compute. Try out Spyder for python. 

IDEA: if residents commit more surgery problems than doctors, could we use simulations in order to prevent medical errors? Can simulations parallel
